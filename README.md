# Comprei

Comprei is an app where you can annotate your market purchases and takes some insights from them.
Know how frequently you buy each kind of item, and how much them cost to you in the last timed you bought.
Read NFE (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica) QR code to retrieve all your purchase items automatically.
At the moment tested only to Android operation system and just for NFE from São Paulo - SP. 

## Privacy oriented
Comprei is a privacy oriented app, no data will be saved in a remote server, 
all data keeps in guard of the user in a cryptographic sqlite database file in the user device's filesystem.
So the user can manage the backup of your data as you wish, in a third cloud solution like google drive, or in its own privacy backup solution. 
But with great privacy powers comes great responsibilities, that's means if you forget your cryptographic password you'll lost all your data, so be careful!
